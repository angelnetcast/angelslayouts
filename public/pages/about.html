          <p>
            <b>all of my layouts are made with editing in mind!</b> i do my best
            to comment them excessively and make it clear what everything does.
            i also try my best to make them acessible, using semantic html and
            other HTML standards.
            <em>please let me know if you find any issue!</em>
          </p>
