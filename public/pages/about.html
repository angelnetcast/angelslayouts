          <h2>layout notes</h2>
          <p>
            all of my layouts are made with editing in mind! i do my best to
            comment them excessively and make it clear what everything does. i
            also try my best to make them acessible, using semantic html and
            other HTML standards. please let me know if you find any issue!
          </p>

          <h2>credits</h2>
          <p>
            <mark>credit is appreciated but not at all required!</mark> all i
            ask is that you please don't claim my layouts as your own.
            everything is free to use, so please be respectful.
          </p>
